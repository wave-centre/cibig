## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Create you own worksapce

Now it is time to settle at home. BUT... wait! What is home?

Let's first create a persistant folder that you will be using during the whole R trainning module:

```{r}
#| label: create my own work folder
wd <- getwd()
myWd <- file.path(wd, "mydatalocal", "myprecious")
gitWd <- "~/mydatalocal/cibig-wave.github.io/docs/course_materials/R"

dir.create(myWd)
```

Now let's bring in some furniture in your space to make it cozy and useful:

```{r}
#| label: create a copy of the github repo qmd files

file.copy(from = file.path(gitWd), "data", to = myWd, recursive = TRUE)
file.copy(from = file.path(gitWd), "rmds", to = myWd, recursive = TRUE)

```
