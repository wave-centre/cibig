title: Program overview
---

The course  provides comprehensive multidisciplinary training in genome sequencing, advancing computing, programming, data reproducibility, open science, and specialized bioinformatics.

* Understanding fundamental bioinformatics concepts 
* Develop practical skills in sequencing genome and analysis of sequencing data.
* Apply bioinformatics to adress agricultural and health challenges in West Africa.
* Master Linux and (bio)informatics tools for research projects.
* Collaborate on practical projects to apply acquired skills.
* Communicate effectively for training and knowledge transfer.
* Integrate open science and reproducibility principles.

## Who is this course for?

* The training is open to students, biologists, researchers, and computer engineers working in either private or public sectors.
* Admission Requirements:
  * At least a Master's degree or equivalent in biological sciences, human health sciences, or animal sciences. 
  * Bachelor's degree plus at least 5 years of experience for professionals working in research organizations and technical ministries."

## Language

The course will be in French, but the slides and other course material will be in English.

## Program structure

* 32 hours of distance learning
* 153 hours in the WAVE center

### Practical sessions

* A tutored project will begin in the second week with data identification and bioinformatics strategy definition, followed by workflow design, data analysis, and a final oral presentation.
* One-Month Internship: Following the 4-week course, each student will complete a supervised immersion internship supervised by two teaching tutors and a researcher from the host laboratory.
