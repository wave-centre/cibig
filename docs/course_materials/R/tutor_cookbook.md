## Forewords

This is primarily a very crude repos that aims at gathering notes about the sections I will be contributing to at the future CIBIG trainning this September.

## A few selected and annotated ressources of special interest on Data Science with R.

-   [<img src="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/cover.jpg" alt="R for Data Science" style="float:right" width="100" height="150"/>](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) The bible written by gods themselves.

-   [Rstudio materials for teaching](https://education.rstudio.com/teach/materials/) offers A LOT of related ressources and even ready to use courses. Some have a one day format wich may be convenient. I like that fact the they define expectations about the minimal level students should have at the begining.

- [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) content fits pretty nicely with what we had in mind.

-   [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/?utm_source=perplexity). A course by Jenny Bryan that is digestible enough without compromise regarding the essential basics. Do not provide much statistical stuff though.

-   [Biggest Collection of Free R Programming Books and Other Resources](https://github.com/javedali99/r-resources-for-data-science). A very BIG and very FREE collection... Need to have critical notion of how to navigate the list and of what is needed or very rapidily lost in the sea of material.

## A rough delineation of the main topics

Remember the R-specific sessions will be 1.5 dyas top.

<details>

1.  R basics and workflows

    </summary>

-   what makes R special? Vectorized Functions, pipes?,

-   R studio a dedicated IDE: main features including accessing packages documentation. Take advantage of this to ask students to find the R syntax for concepts that have been covered in the previeous "algo" section.

-   packages ecosystemS: CRAN, bioconductor, rOpenSci, Tidyverse ... -\> R-universe system

## Questions for discussion with other mentors

-  Datasets: flag stat table from bioanalysis + matrice snp
-  A preexisting set of teaching slides on Quarto: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vkFpqBcePRZ0XL8OE0KnhrbfDnjKYh813Wntk-6lxGU/edit?usp=drive_link





## Misc ideas/comments

-   In such a trainning shouldn't we devote some time to illustrate how AI can be used to ease/speed planning and programming?
-   What about regular expressions?
