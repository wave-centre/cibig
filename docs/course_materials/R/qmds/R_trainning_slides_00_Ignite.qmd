## Quarto

Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of [**R Markdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) from **Posit** (aka RStudio...), with many new new features and capabilities.

Take a look at `>Help>Markdown Quick Reference` in the RStudio menu.

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. Click on the link to learn more about [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)

## Let's have a quick satisfiying experience before the hard work...

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

::: callout-important
## You can try to see what happens?...
:::

::: callout-tip
## Do you think the code blocks below were executed during kniting? Why is that?
:::

Now modify the `format` parameter value in the YAML header above:

```         
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: false
```

to this value:
```         
format: revealjs
```

And render again to see what happens.

## Quarto is quite convenient to quickly change the format of the output document without bothering to change anything else...

## Create you own worksapce

Now it is time to settle at home. BUT... wait! What is home?

Let's first create a persistent folder that you will be using during the whole R training module:

```{r}
#| label: create my own work folder

wd <- getwd()
myProjectDir <- file.path(wd, "ifbdata", "mydatalocal", "myprecious")
localGitDir <- "~/mydatalocal/cibig-wave.github.io/docs/course_materials/R"

dir.create(myProjectDir, recursive = TRUE)
setwd(myProjectDir)
```

> ðŸ¥º What is this **code chunk** doing?

Now let's bring some furniture in your space to make it cozy and useful:

```{r}
#| label: create a copy of the github repo qmd files

file.copy(from = file.path(localGitDir, "data"), # External 'data' files for our playground
          to = myProjectDir,
          recursive = TRUE)
file.copy(from = file.path(localGitDir, "qmds"), # The actual Quarto files we will be studying
          to = myProjectDir,
          recursive = TRUE)
head(list.dirs(myProjectDir))
```

What is `list.dirs` doing? What the hell is `head` used for?

## Advices on how to get your files organized

-   It makes sense to start implementing basic practices for **reproducible science**, right now! You will have a dedicated module soon...

-   [Here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro.html) are some best practices applied to a R Studio environment

-   Let's create a R project in your `myProjectDir` folder (`r myProjectDir`). This is useful for various reasons.

-   although you could in principle work directly with the `.qmd` files in the folder we just copied in your project, I recommend that you create your own `.qmd` file(s) in a dedicated `src`

-   in addition you should create a `results` directory that will host all output files created during the training.

```{r}
#| label: TIP on how to do that...

lapply(X = file.path(myProjectDir, c("src", "results")),
       FUN = function(pth) {
         dir.create(pth, recursive = TRUE)
         }
       )
```

## NOW let's move on to our first actual topic...
